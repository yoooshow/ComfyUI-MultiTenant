"""SSRF / exfiltration defenses.

Two cooperating layers:

1. :class:`ValidatingResolver` is installed on the shared connector. Every
   connection — the initial probe and every segment GET, including ones made
   after a redirect — resolves its host through this resolver, which rejects
   any address that lands on a private / special-use IP range. Because the
   resolve and the connect happen together inside the connector, there is no
   check-then-connect window for DNS rebinding to exploit.

2. :func:`check_redirect_hop` re-validates every redirect hop. The host
   allowlist gates only the *initial* user-supplied URL (anti-SSRF for
   arbitrary input); legitimate downloads from allowlisted origins redirect
   to presigned CDN hosts that are deliberately NOT on the allowlist (HF ->
   ``cdn-lfs*.huggingface.co``, Civitai -> signed Cloudflare/S3), so hops are
   instead screened for scheme, embedded credentials, and — via the resolver
   above — private IPs. Credentials are only ever attached when a hop's host
   exactly matches a stored credential, so they are dropped on the CDN hop.
